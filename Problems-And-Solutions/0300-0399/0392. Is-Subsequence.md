# 0392. Is-Subsequence

Given two strings  `s`  and  `t`, return  `true` _if_ `s` _is a  **subsequence**  of_ `t`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

A  **subsequence**  of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e.,  `"ace"`  is a subsequence of  `"abcde"`  while  `"aec"`  is not).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= s.length <= 100`
-   `0 <= t.length <= 104`
-   `s`  and  `t`  consist only of lowercase English letters.

# Solution

### Python

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isSubsequence(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if len(s) == 0:
            return True
        j = 0
        n = len(t)
        for i in range(n):
            if s[j] == t[i]:
                j = j + 1
                if j == len(s):
                    return True
        return False
