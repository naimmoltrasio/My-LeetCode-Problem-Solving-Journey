# 1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string  `text`  of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string  `brokenLetters`  of all  **distinct**  letter keys that are broken, return  _the  **number of words**  in_  `text`  _you can fully type using this keyboard_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "lt"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We cannot type "leet" because the 'l' and 't' keys are broken.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "e"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** We cannot type either word because the 'e' key is broken.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= text.length <= 104`
-   `0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26`
-   `text`  consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
-   Each word only consists of lowercase English letters.
-   `brokenLetters`  consists of  **distinct**  lowercase English letters.

# Solution

### Python

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canBeTypedWords(self, text, brokenLetters):
        """
        :type text: str
        :type brokenLetters: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        words = 0
        broken = False

        for i in text:
            if i == " ":
                if not broken:
                    words += 1
                broken = False
            elif i in brokenLetters:
                broken = True

        if not broken:
            return words + 1
        else:
            return words
