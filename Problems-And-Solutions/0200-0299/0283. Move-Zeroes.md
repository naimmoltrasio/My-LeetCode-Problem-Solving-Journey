# 0283. Move Zeroes

Given an integer array  `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note**  that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
**Output:** [1,3,12,0,0]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0]
**Output:** [0]

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
-   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

# Solution

The important thing to remember in this problem is that we **must** do the movement in-place and we can't make a copy of the array.

Having this in mind, the approach I had was to simply keep track of the last zero in the array and switch it with the next non-zero element.

### Example:

[0, 1, 0, 3, 12] element = 0, last_zero = 0

[0, 1, 0, 3, 12] element = 1, last_zero = 0 (switch and add 1 to last_zero counter)

[1, 0, 0, 3, 12] element = 0, last_zero = 1

[1, 0, 0, 3, 12] element = 3, last_zero = 1 (switch and add 1 to last_zero counter)

[1, 3, 0, 0, 12] element = 12, last_zero = 2 (switch and add 1 to last_zero counter)

[1, 3, 12, 0, 0] end of array



### Python

```python
class Solution(object):
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        last_zero = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != 0:
                nums[last_zero], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[last_zero]
                last_zero += 1
```
